### Instagram_Production

In this project we tried to automate instagram using selenium. 

The project is divided into 2 parts. In first part we will be extracting user data like username, number of followers, post and followees and account type. The details of data extraction is given in following [notebook](https://github.com/abbi163/Instagram_Production/blob/master/PotentialFollowers.ipynb)

In second part, we will be using this data to extract feature and find out which user is most likely to follow back if we interact with them by liking there picture and following them. The details are given in the following [notebook](https://github.com/abbi163/Instagram_Production/blob/master/notebbook/abbijeetanand/AutoScript-V1.1.ipynb)
